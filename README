This code contains the data sets used by NetworkSIR/EnvironmentalSIR, specified
as adjacency lists. The files themselves include some metadata at the top, in the form of:

N = <#nodes>
Infect Nodes <IDs of the nodes to infect, or -1 if they should be chosen randomly. (adjust INFECT_X_NODES in NetworkSIR/EnvironmentalSIR's Runner.java) as needed>
Recovered nodes <IDs of the nodes to initialize as being recovered, or -1 if there are none.>
Environment nodes <IDs of the nodes to infect, or -1 if they should be chosen randomly. (adjust ENV_X_NODES in NetworkSIR/EnvironmentalSIR's Runner.java) as needed>

The rest of the lines are of the form:
<nodeID>: <nodeID to have a directed edge to> <nodeID to have a directed edge to> ... (etc)
	
Please note that these lists were generated using code written by @author Madison Pickering.
